Adopt a Family Dog - WIP
========================

As a User, so that I can find a furry friend to join my family, 
I'd like to see what dogs are adoptable nearby.

As a User, so that i can find the right fit for my family, 
I'd like to filter my search to specific criteria.

As a User, so that I don't have to create a new search every visit,
I'd like to save my search criteria for easy repeat searches.

As a User, so that I can learn more about each dog I'm interested in, 
I'd like there to be links to detailed information.

As a User, so I can snatch up the perfect dog before anyone else, 
I'd like to have contact info for each dog's adoption process.
